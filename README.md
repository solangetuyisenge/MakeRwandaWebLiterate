# MakeRwandaWebLiterate
Welcome
Hello!
Thank you for your interest in Make Rwanda Web Literate project. This document aims at giving you information about the project and how we can work together to make it a success. Continue below for more details.
What are we doing?
Rwanda as a country that strives to become a knowledge based economy relies on skilled citizens to be able to achieve it’s vision.

The problem

According to Rwandan statistics, only 10% of Rwandans have access to internet and most of internet users live in urban communities
Elderly and people from rural communities have means to purchase internet bundles but lack skills on how to use it.
There is still a significant gap between men and women when it comes to digital skills and access to internet.

Our solution

Make Rwanda Web Literate project will equip citizens with digital skills, and make sure they feel safe on internet focusing on people from underserved communities and women.
With the help of youth known as digital ambassadors we carry out awareness campaigns and willing citizens join our training program. Participants are given one month training and then form learning clubs where they keep learning together and use the gain skills to design income generating projects.
Who are we?
We are a team of partners whose vision is to see more Rwandan become web literate and internet users. We partner with Digital Opportunity Trust Rwanda(Dot Rwanda) , Mozilla Foundation and Mitec to reach out  to citizens, provide them with content and coordinate the project.
DOT Rwanda  is a youth-led movement of daring social innovators who have the tools, knowledge, and networks to create opportunities and transform their own communities. Mozilla Foundation believes the Internet must always remain a global public resource that is open and accessible to all and focuses on fueling the movement for an open Internet. Mitec is the  Rwandan Ministry of IT & communications and it’s mission is to "address national priorities for economic growth and poverty reduction through the development and coordination of national policies related to Information & Communication Technology policies.

What do we need?

We need your help in making the project successful. We can use your expertise in awareness to make sure citizens are informed about and join our program, to come up with localized content that suits our users needs, fundraising to improve our training rooms and equip them with computers and internet, building entrepreneurship skills our club members and help them implement their business ideas.
