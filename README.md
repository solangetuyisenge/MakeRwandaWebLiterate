Welcome! Hello! Thank you for your interest in the Make Rwanda Web Literate project. This document aims at giving you information about the project and how we can work together to make it a success. Continue to read below for more details. 
What are we doing? 
Rwanda as a country that strives to become a knowledge-based economy relies on skilled citizens to be able to achieve its vision.
The problem
According to Rwandan statistics, only 10% of Rwandans have access to internet and most internet users live in urban communities. Elderly and people from rural communities have means to purchase internet bundles but lack skills on how to use it. There is also still a significant gap between men and women when it comes to digital skills and access to internet.
Our solution
The Make Rwanda Web Literate project will equip citizens with digital skills, and make sure they feel safe while on the internet, focusing support to people from underserved communities and women. With the help of youth known as digital ambassadors we carry out awareness campaigns and encouragecitizens join our training program. Participants are given a one month training and then form learning clubs where they keep learning together and use the gain skills to design income generating projects. 
Who are we? 
We are a team of partners whose vision is to see Rwandn become web literate and more Rwandan internet users. We partner with Digital Opportunity Trust Rwanda (Dot Rwanda) , Mozilla Foundation and Mitec to reach out to citizens, provide them with content and coordinate the project. DOT Rwanda is a youth-led movement of daring social innovators who have the tools, knowledge, and networks to create opportunities and transform their own communities. Mozilla Foundation believes the Internet must always remain a global public resource that is open and accessible to all and focuses on fueling the movement for an open internet. Mitec is the Rwandan Ministry of IT & Communications and their mission is to "address national priorities for economic growth and poverty reduction through the development and coordination of national policies related to Information & Communication Technology policies.‚Äù

We can use your expertise to make sure citizens are informed about and join our program, to come up with localized content that suits our users needs, on fundraising tactics to raise funds to improve our training rooms and equip them with computers and internet, in how to build entrepreneurship skills for our club members and help them implement their business ideas.
